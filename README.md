# Chess

#  Description

The purpose of the project was to create a chess game with a dedicated logic engine, with the possibility to play by mouse and keyboard (chess algebraic notation in a separate translation module). Moreover, according to assumptions, the game should contain mechanisms of:
* **Possibility to play with a bot** controlled by a dedicated **convolutional neural network** model;
* **Multiplayer mode** with communication by **IPv6**;
* **Game saving in SQLite** database and XML file;
* **Millisecond analog clocks** for each player;
* **Saving game status** in JSON file;
* **Animated history playback** gave from the file (controlled by the engine);
* **Marking possible moves** while holding a piece.
* 
The application was written in Python 3.10.9, using the Qt Framework, in the PyCharm 2023.1.1 (Professional Edition) environment.

# User interfece

Interface is splitted to two main parts:
  * Input user interface with:
      * Text box with adequate mask for IPv6 (multiplayer mode);
      * Port Text box (multiplayer mode);
      * Grid layout to choose game mode;
      * Combo boxes to choice game to load or game settings;
      * Button to apply all of the configurations.

  * The game user interface contains:
      * Board section with pieces, labels, and the possibility to change color style;
      * Check / Mate buttons to inform about game status;
      * A text box for inserting moves in chess algebraic notation. Move confirmation could be preceded by “Submit text move button” or pressing Enter in the text box;
      * Light and dark clocks for each player;
      * Continue button to submit proceed move and change clock;
      * Start, Reset and Save Buttons to control the game
      * Additional window to choose pawn promotion.
